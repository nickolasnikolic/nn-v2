          <h2>personal</h2>
          <p>In my professional life, I most recently served More Than Rewards' mission
            primarily as a mobile developer. In the past I've been a webmaster, support
            professional, photographer, multimedia journalist, automotive factory worker,
            even a dairy farmer. I'm oddly familiar with many things in many
            industries.</p>

          <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>I graduated from art school with a BFA in 2004. Around the time that I
              graduated I tripped across PHP and the open-source paradigm.</p>

            <p>I was hooked. I was so enamored by the social utility of the
              open-source process that it made my head spin.</p>

            <p>I wanted to contribute, so I created my first icon set for KDE
              in 2003. I got a job in support that offered free training in
              virtually any technology and took over 400 credit hours of training
              in technology ranging from programming languages, encryption, server
              technologies, and applications. I took the job mostly for this
              training benefit, alone.</p>

            <p>Over the course of the last 10 years I have been involved in
              open-source software continually, and have been involved in more
              than 60 projects as of the time of this writing.</p>

          <h2>In my personal life</h2>
          <p>He is also an
            internationally published photojournalist/photographer specializing in
            Creative Commons media for niche publications such as
            Marxist.com,TreeHugger.com, DeliberateLife Magazine and hundreds of
            others. I have taken assignments through Demotix.com as a local
            photojournalist as well as through the Center for Media Change and
            American Public Media.</p>
